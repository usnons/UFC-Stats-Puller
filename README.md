# UFC-Stats-Puller
Pulls stats from all fighters on current roster.

This project scrapes data from the UFCStats website using Python and BeautifulSoup, and outputs the stats of all fighters into a CSV file. The data includes each fighter's first and last name, nickname (if any), height, weight, reach, stance, wins, losses, draws, and belt. The program can be run with a single command and the resulting file can be used for further analysis. This project showcases web scraping, data processing, and file I/O skills, and can serve as a starting point for exploring UFC fighter stats or similar websites.
